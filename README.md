# IMOWOA
A novel multi-objective whale optimization algorithm (IMOWOA) is proposed. The elite-oriented multi-mode adaptive perturbation (EMAP) and random single-dimensional update (RSDU) strategies are introduced to enable the whale optimization algorithm (WOA) to focus on the elite region and enhance local exploration.
